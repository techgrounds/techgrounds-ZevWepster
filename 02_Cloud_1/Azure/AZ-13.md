Bestudeer:

**App Service**

Azure App Service is a HTTP based service (PaaS) for hosting web applications, REST API's and mobile back-ends. You can develop in any programming language. Applications can be easily executed and scaled in Windows and Linux-based environments.

App Service adds the power of Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, automatic scaling and automated management. additionally you can benefit from DevOps capabilities such as contininuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.

You pay for the Azure compute resources you use. This will determined by the App Service Plan under wich you run your apps.

There are other services you can use to host websites and web applications. For most cases App service is the best choice though. For the microservice architecture you could use Azure Spring Apps or Service Fabric. If you want more control over the VMs your code is applied to you can use Azure Virtual Machine. 

**Content Delivery Network (CDN)**

A CDN is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. a CDN store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.

Azure CDN offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which can't get cached, by using various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

It works as follows:

![CDN](../../00_includes/AZ-13/CDN.png)

1. A user (Alice) requests a file (also called an asset) by using a URL with a special domain name, such as <endpoint name>.azureedge.net. This name can be an endpoint hostname or a custom domain. The DNS routes the request to the best performing POP location, which is usually the POP that is geographically closest to the user.

2. If no edge servers in the POP have the file in their cache, the POP requests the file from the origin server. The origin server can be an Azure Web App, Azure Cloud Service, Azure Storage account, or any publicly accessible web server.

3. The origin server returns the file to an edge server in the POP.

4. An edge server in the POP caches the file and returns the file to the original requestor (Alice). The file remains cached on the edge server in the POP until the time-to-live (TTL) specified by its HTTP headers expires. If the origin server didn't specify a TTL, the default TTL is seven days.

5. More users can then request the same file by using the same URL that Alice used, and gets directed to the same POP.

6. If the TTL for the file hasn't expired, the POP edge server returns the file directly from the cache. This process results in a faster, more responsive user experience.

A real world use-case example would be Netflix who has content stored closer to the user group for less latency.

**Azure DNS**

Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

You can't use Azure DNS to buy a domain name. For an annual fee, you can buy a domain name by using App Service domains or a third-party domain name registrar. Your domains then can be hosted in Azure DNS for record management.

The following features are included with Azure DNS:

- Security: Azure DNS is based on AzureResource Manager wich provides features such as:
    - Azure Role-Based Access Control (Azure RBAC)
    - Activity logs
    - Resource locking
- DNSSEC

Azure DNS does not currently support DNSSEC. In most cases, you can reduce the need for DNSSEC by consistently using HTTPS/TLS in your applications. If DNSSEC is a critical requirement for your DNS zones, you can host these zones with third-party DNS hosting providers.

- Ease of use
- Customizable virtual networks with private domains
- Alias records

In the assignments we will also look at it in a more practical side with the following questions:

    - Waar kan ik deze dienst vinden in de console?
    - Hoe zet ik deze dienst aan?
    - Hoe kan ik deze dienst koppelen aan andere resources?

**- Azure Files**

- Waar is Azure Files voor?

        Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, Network File System (NFS) protocol, and Azure Files REST API. 
        
        Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments. SMB Azure file shares are accessible from Windows, Linux, and macOS clients. NFS Azure file shares are accessible from Linux clients. Additionally, SMB Azure file shares can be cached on Windows servers with Azure File Sync for fast access near where the data is being used.

- Hoe past Azure Files / vervangt Azure Files in een on-premises setting?
        
        It will replace the psycial storage on premis file servers.

- Hoe kan ik Azure Files combineren met andere diensten?

        You can mount this to VMs, App-services or Containers, wich are the most common uses but it depends on the resource what method to use.

- Wat is het verschil tussen Azure Files en andere gelijksoortige diensten?

        Azure Files provides a shared file system interface, compatibility with various operating systems, and different storage tiers, making it ideal for applications that require traditional file system operations. Other services such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Disk Storage are more focused on object storage and have different interfaces and functionalities tailored to specific use cases.


- Waar kan ik deze dienst vinden in de console?

        You can deploy Azure Files in two main ways: by directly mounting the serverless Azure file shares or by caching Azure file shares on-premises using Azure File Sync. Deployment considerations will differ based on which option you choose.

- Hoe zet ik deze dienst aan?

        For Azure file share access you will need to make a storage account, where you then can make a file share. Both are needed if you want to set up a File Sync.

        the prerequisites for deploying a file sync are:

        1. An Azure file share in the same region you want to deploy Azure File Sync.
        2. The following setting in your storage account must be enabled to allow File Sync access
            - SMB security settings must allow SMB 3.1.1 protocol version, NTLM v2 authentication and AES-128-GCM encryption.
            - Allow storage account key access must be Enabled.
        3. At least one supported instance of Windows Server to sync with.
        4. Optional: If you intend to use Azure File Sync with a Windows Server Failover Cluster, the File Server for general use role must be configured prior to installing the Azure File Sync agent on each node in the cluster. 
        5. Although cloud management can be done with the Azure portal, advanced registered server functionality is provided through PowerShell cmdlets that are intended to be run locally in either PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 6+.

- Hoe kan ik deze dienst koppelen aan andere resources?
       You can mount this to VMs, App-services or Containers, wich are the most common uses but it depends on the resource what method to use.
       


**Azure Database**

- Waar is Azure Database voor?

        Azure Database is a cloudbased database service of Microsoft Azure wich offers scalable and manageable envoirments. It offers many database services for example:
        - Azure SQL Database
        - Azure Cosmos DB 
        - Azure Database for MySQL
        - Azure Database for PostgreSQL

- Hoe past Azure Database / vervangt Azure Database in een on-premises setting?

         In a on-premis setting organizations would manage and maintain their databases on local servers. Azure Database offers the possibility to move those databases to the cloud. Potentially saving on investing in hardware and maintanance of it. 

         Azure Database can be used as a replacement for on-premises databases, with existing databases being migrated to the Azure cloud.

- Hoe kan ik Azure Database combineren met andere diensten?

        Azure Virtual Network can be used to establish a private network connection between Azure Database and other resources for secure communication.

        Azure Monitor can be used to monitor performance and health of Azure Database.

        These are just some examples, there are many other Azure services that you can use to integrate, depending on the requirments of your application.

- Wat is het verschil tussen Azure Database en andere gelijksoortige diensten?

        The difference between Azure Database and other similar services like AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) or Google Cloud SQL lies in the cloud provider-specific implementations and the specific database services offered.

        To get a better understanding of the different database services within Azure I will explain the difference of them aswell.

        - Azure SQL Database is a managed relational database service for running SQL workloads.

        - Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distibuted NoSQL database service that support multiple data models and API's. Designed for high responsitivity with low latency responses (less than 10ms) and Multi-regional applications
        
        - Azure Database for MySQL is a fully managed MySQL database service, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a fully managed PostgreSQL database service, both providing scalable and secure environments for their respective database systems.
