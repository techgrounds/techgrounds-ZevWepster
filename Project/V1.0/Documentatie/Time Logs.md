# Time Logs Project V1.0



# **Log 21-08-2023**


## Dagverslag (1 zin)

Today I took the time to read the document and write down questions to discuss with my team so the scrum master can discuss this with the Project Owner.


## Obstakels

- Where to start.
- What do I need to actually make this project happen.


## Oplossingen

- Read the documentation multiple times and discuss with peers.
- Create a list with services you might need to get a better understanding of where to start.
- Visualize the project using [Miro - Mind Maps](https://miro.com)

## Learnings

- It is important to really know what the client wants
- dissecting a problem really helps with overview

Used today to figure out if things work (individually) the way I think they will (trough the Portal), made appointment with Product Owner and made documentation ready for the future.

## Obstakels

- VM takes very long to deploy
- What to do when things do not work as intended
- No plan of action

## Oplossingen

- Change the Resource Group
- Ask, ask, ask 
- Dissect and write down the things asked in Jira (a project management planner)

## Learnings
- Resource Crunching
- Writing things down in a schematic way gives more clarity
