Study:
- The difference between authentication and authorization.

    Authentication checks who you are and Authorization checks if you are allowed to do the things you want to do.

- The three factors of authentication and how MFA improves security.

    The 3 factors can be explained as:

    - Know: This is a password or a pincode, things you know and remember. But so can someone else so it is rather easy to "pretend to be you".

    - Have: A message gets send to a pre registered device that only you have. wich makes it harder to 'pretend to be me'

    - Are: This security layer is often combined with 'have' because let's say you have registered a phone you will probably unlock it with either your fingerprint or face recognition wich makes this the most secure layer because someone needs to steal your face and/or fingers.

- What the principle of least privilege is and how it improves security.

The principle of least privilege (PoLP) refers to an information security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform his/her job functions.

Least privilege extends beyond human access. The model can be applied to applications, systems or connected devices that require privileges or permissions to perform a required task. Least privilege enforcement ensures the non-human tool has the requisite access needed, and nothing more.
