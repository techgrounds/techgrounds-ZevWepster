**SEC-04 - Symmetric encryption**

**Symetric encrytion:** Is a one way encrytion. All messages being send, back and forth, are open by the same key. There is a security risk involed using this method since it is very hard to communicate the key without it being comprimized.

- Find one more historic cipher besides the Caesar cipher.

    His nephew, August, also used a cipher, but a right shift one which did not wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet.

- Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.

    **AES:** Advanced Encryption Standard  is the algorithm trusted as the standard by the U.S. Government and numerous organizations. Although it is highly efficient in 128-bit form, AES also uses keys of 192 and 256 bits for heavy-duty encryption purposes.

    AES is largely considered impervious to all attacks, except for brute force, which attempts to decipher messages using all possible combinations in the 128, 192, or 256-bit cipher.

    **Blowfish:** Blowfish is as AES designed to replace DES (Data Encryption Standard) This symmetric cipher splits messages into blocks of 64 bits and encrypts them individually. Blowfish is known for its tremendous speed and overall effectiveness. Meanwhile, vendors have taken full advantage of its free availability in the public domain. You'll find Blowfish in software categories ranging from e-commerce platforms for securing payments to password management tools, where it protects passwords. It's one of the more flexible encryption methods available.


- Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone. You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides the public Slack channel. Analyse the shortcomings of symmetric encryption for sending messages.

There is no real safe way to share a key with symetrical encryption other than using a asymetrtic encrypted message with someones key in there.
