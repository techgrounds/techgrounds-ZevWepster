**PRG-02 - Variables**
===
**Key-terms**
---

**Assignment**: This refers to the process of giving a value to a variable. For example, x = 10 assigns the value 10 to the variable x.

**Data Type**: Every variable in Python has a data type that defines the type of value it can hold. Common data types include integers (**int**), floating-point numbers (**float**), strings (**str**), lists (**list**), dictionaries (**dict**), and more.

**Scope**: Scope refers to the region in your code where a variable is valid and can be accessed. Variables can have local scope, which means they are only accessible within a certain function or block of code, or global scope, which means they can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
