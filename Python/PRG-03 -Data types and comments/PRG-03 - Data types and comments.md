**PRG-03- Data Types and comments**
===
**Key-terms**
---

**int**: Integers is awhole number without decimal or fractional parts.

**float**: Floating point numbers (ex. 8,4)

**str**: String, is a piece of text that always has "string" or 'string'. 

**list**: To list things in your code you use [].

**dict**: In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that represents an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key in the dictionary is unique and associated with a corresponding value. Dictionaries are useful for storing and retrieving data based on these key-value associations.

Here's a basic breakdown of how dictionaries work:

    **Keys**: Keys are used to access the values in the dictionary. They must be unique and immutable (meaning they cannot be changed after creation). Common examples of keys are strings, integers, and tuples.

    **Values**: Values are the data associated with the keys. They can be of any data type: strings, numbers, lists, other dictionaries, etc.

    For example:

    my_dict = {
        "name": "Zev",
        "age": 31,
        "city": "Amsterdam"
    }

In this example, "name", "age", and "city" are keys, and "Zev", 31, and "Amsterdam" are their corresponding values.

#Exercise 1:

- Create a new script.
- Copy the code below into your script.
    a = 'int'
    b = 7
    c = False
    d = "18.5"
- Determine the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using a built in function.

![dataTypes](<../../00_includes/Python/PRG-03 - Data types/dataTypes.png>)


- Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
- Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

#Exercise 2:

- Create a new script.
- Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
- Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
