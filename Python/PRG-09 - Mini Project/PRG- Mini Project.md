# PRG- Mini Project

Make a mini gamne in python. We got given 3 options for games to make. A number guessing game, Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) or tic tac toe.

## Key-terms



## Opdracht

Since I already made a number guessing game in the past i decided to go for RPS. 

### Rock Paper Scissors:
- The player plays against a computer opponent typing either a letter (rps) or an entire word (rock paper scissors) to play their move.
- Create a function that checks whether the move is valid or not.
- Create another function to create a computer move.
- Create another function to check who wins the round.
- Finally, create a function that keeps track of the score.
- The game should be played in a predetermined number of rounds.

### Ervaren problemen
Because I had parts of the code already made in my Bingo game I got confused on where to add the rest of the functions. Whilst trying, other things kept breaking or did not work the way I intended. In the end i decided to start over to piece al the elements together in a more structured way.
